## Guiding Principles
### Open Government
Transparency and accountability are foundational to successful democratic governance. In order for citizens to be informed, they must have ready access to information to make good decisions about who to support, and how to vote in elections and on referenda.

In Civic OS, accountability is achieved by enforcing the justification of decisions; in other words, forcing leaders to justify key decisions. In order for an individual to decide if he supports an action, he must be able to understand the rationale behind that decision.
### Open Data
All data is not created equal. In order to make data open and usable the Open Data Charter has published [6 key
principles](https://opendatacharter.net/principles/):
- Open By Default
- Timely and Comprehensive
- Accessible and Usable
- Comparable and Interoperable
- For Improved Governance & Citizen Engagement
- For Inclusive Development and Innovation
### Open Source
The term “open source” can have a number of meanings but Civic OS uses the definition consistent with “free software” according to the [Free Software Foundation](https://www.fsf.org/about/what-is-free-software).

The two primary outcomes of this philosophy are democratic development and lower cost of entry. Democratic development allows entities to contribute to development (in code, financial, and administrative contributions) to influence the system’s evolution. This results in a system that is useful for a broad range of diverse organizations. Lower cost of entry is realized by the $0 licensing fees inherent in Free/Open Source software. When development is performed in the open, the cost is shared by an entire community.

## Goals
### Tools, not Products
Civic OS is designed to allow experts in the information domain to create and maintain information systems without writing software code.
### Raise the level of abstraction
We believe that most information systems or processes can be abstracted in a way that non-technical personnel can understand and (critically) contribute to their creation.

## Abstractions
To accommodate breaking a system into components, we propose the following abstractions. Every abstraction can be thought of as a computing primitive (in the vein of a "File" or "Folder") which may have configurable properties, but can be represented by a graph or diagram to visually represent its construction. These graphs are a key enabler to bridge the gap between technical and non-technical ideas and persons.
### Schema
### Workflow
### Events/Triggers


## Governance
The Civic OS software is designed to maximize civic benefit, which should direct the legal structure of the supporting organization. This organization has not yet been formed, but we believe that a non-profit or Public Benefit Corp. will provide the best opportunities to mature and spread the use of Civic OS.
