## Software Architecture
The inspiration behind this architecture is SQL and its declarative model. When you write SQL scripts, you are telling the database engine _what_ you want, not _how_ you want the engine to do it. This is a very powerful mental model and can allow the system to bridge the gap between non-technical personnel and very technical systems.
